# CSCI401 Database Management App

The app is created upon request of USC Accessibility Department, aiming at visualizing and managing the policy database.

Functionalities:
  - View all policies
  - Search policy by name
  - View selected policy detail
  - Edit selected policy detail
  - Add policy
  - Delete policy
  - Export policy detail
  
ToDo:
  - A better UI design can be implemented if one does get produced
  - Export should be made better, especially design wise
  - Potentially this will be moved to be hosted online.
